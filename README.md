# FordProgrammingExercise
Coding exercise for 2021 Ford Motor Credit Company- SWE internship exercise. I am aware only one exercise was required. Here are the source files, executables, and makefile for exercise 1 and 2. 


Hello!

The executables were compiled on a Linux virtual machine, but I included a makefile for compiling for MacOS. 

For exercise 1:
Use "./EX1" to run. The program will prompt the user for coordinate inputs.
Add command line arguments to give coordinates: "./EX1 -4 3 7 10"
Use "./EX1 test" to use the automated verification tests.


For exercise 2:
Use "./EX2" to run. The program will prompt the user for a number input.
Add a command line argument to give the number input: "./EX1 15"
Use "./EX2 test" to use the automated verification tests.
